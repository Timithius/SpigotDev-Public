All code stored on these repositories is free to use and modify as you see fit. You are allowed to customize it any way you'd like, but you are not allowed to change author credit in the plugin.yml unless you are modifying core functionality of the plugin.

If you'd like to change the code of the plugins you will need to import their code into a new project and recompile using your own machine, otherwise you will have to use the plugins stock.
